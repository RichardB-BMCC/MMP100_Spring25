		<h1>The Magic fills you</h1>
		<p>You’ve aligned yourself with the wild — the roots, the wind, the quiet strength of stone. Nature answers your call, but its language is vast and untamed. To focus this magic, you must choose your spellbook wisely. One will ground you in balance… the other may twist the very elements you command.</p>

		<p>Choose your magical tool. The guide that will accompany you through your journey.</p>
